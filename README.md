##Stock Trading AI

This website will be the project's page for the stock trading AI, keeping any updates on it! This AI is by no means perfect, as it assumes there is no relation between the input variables, when in actuality that's what economics is all about!!

This is just a super naive approach where the goal is to get something that trades at a rate better than chance.

###Update 2
Has the foundation for testing the data it currently contains to assume some error rate about itself using k-cross validation.

###Update 1
Now can predict the next 5 minutes of the stock market using 5 features - high, low, opening, close, and volume - using singular value decomposition to construct weights for individual features.
